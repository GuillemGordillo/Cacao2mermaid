# Cacao2mermaid

This script is used to create the graph representation of a [CACAO](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=cacao) playbook and to provide some syntax validation for the playbooks.


## Usage

In order to try the script, you should have a folder named **playbooks** within the same directory and it will generate the markdown representation of each json file in that directory simply by running the python script named cacao2mermaid.py
